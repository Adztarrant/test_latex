# Why git/github?

 * a repository
   * historical storage of a work process
   * (in German) Ablage, Lagerst√§tte, Deponie, Verwahrungsort, Lager, Speicher, ...
   * instead of having multiply files (project_v1.txt, project_v2.txt, ...) you will have versions (linear within in one branch or parallel using multiply branches)

 * mainly used for code development since it allows:
   * splitting development for testing
   * undoing development
   * tagging a version/release
   * collaborative code development 
   * github: documentation (README.md, wiki, www)
   * github: issue tracker 
  * github: nightly builds

* philosophy of modularity: commiting many small changes provides clarity

# Example 1: Create your own repository



# Example 2: Getting/developing on an existing repository
